<p>This postdoctoral position is an opportunity to contribute to the design of the upcoming 701 and 702 HIV vaccine trials to maximize power in subsequent statistical analyses. Specifically, it will be to help design the trials so that infection time and founder sequences can be inferred with maximum fidelity. The scope of the study design includes sampling times and sequencing protocol, and also may afford some opportunities to design novel ways of combining sequencing methodologies. The project will last two years, with some possibility of extension. It may also offer an option to travel to South Africa to help teach a short course at the University of Cape Town, and possibly interact with the Fred Hutchinson Research Institute there.</p>
<p>This position will require significant statistics expertise, programming ability, and of course interest in collaboration. For a bit more detail, see the <a href="http://matsen.fhcrc.org/general/2014/04/11/HVTN-postdoc.html">post</a> on my website.</p>
