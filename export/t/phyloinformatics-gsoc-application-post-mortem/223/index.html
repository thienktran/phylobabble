<p>I hope I’m not bringing up bad memories, but can someone (perhaps <span class="mention">@hlapp</span>?) tell us a little about Google’s response to the phyoinformatics GSOC application? Was there something special about this year, or was it shifting priorities on their part?</p>
<p>You all have a very strong track record with them in the past! It would be great to continue this program.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@karen_cranston</span> would be the one to comment in detail. There were so many bioinformatics organizations applying (which is a great thing, and a remarkable change to when we first participated) that they needed to reject some organizations that had participated in the past in order to make room for new ones.</p>
<p>FYI, Google has regularly shuffled things up - many large and very prominent organizations have failed to get accepted in some years. For example, <a href="http://www.open-bio.org" rel="nofollow noopener">OBF</a> was rejected last year, but got in again this year. The Perl Foundation was out in the past and is in this year. The R foundation is also out this year.</p>

<p>Hilmar’s summary is spot on. It is unfortunate, but there is no need to think that this eliminates a phyloinformatics summer of code from future years (although, the end of NESCent funding will require new folks to step up for admin).</p>
