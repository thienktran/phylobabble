<p>A workshop on Mathematical Approaches to Evolutionary Trees and Networks was recently held at the Banff International Research Station. Most of the talks were recorded and are available at <a href="http://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-workshops/17w5104/videos" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-workshops/17w5104/videos</a> .</p>
<p>The topics covered include the BHV tree space, phylogenetic tree and network inference, species and gene tree inference and reconciliation, phylogenetic tree shape metrics, transmission networks and others (including my talk on the SPR tree space).</p>
<p>A list of open problems that were raised at the workshop will be posted some time next week and I will link to it here in a followup post.</p>
