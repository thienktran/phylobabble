<p>Hi everyone! I have been doing research on the TKF91 model and its successors for over a year now. Recently, I have been tasked with writing a research proposal, on mathematical / statistical / computational aspects of indel models, for a general math-professor audience.</p>
<p>It seems that, for Markovian indel models at least, continuous-time models (TKF91, TKF92, long indel, Poisson indel, etc.) are much more popular than discrete-time models. (I only know of one discrete-time indel model, due to David Koslicki in his PhD <a href="https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/14024" rel="nofollow noopener">thesis</a>. And this work has only 7 citations.) I have been wondering why this is the case. Why have continuous-time models been so much more popular than discrete-time models? And relatedly, why did TKF choose continuous time over discrete time for their 1991 paper?</p>
<p>If I know that discrete-time models are actually valid, then I can avoid continuous-time models in my proposal (to make things less confusing to the reader). In addition, depending on the virtues of continuous time versus discrete time, it may make a good research proposal to study discrete-time indel models until we understand them as well as continuous-time indel models.</p>
<p>One possible argument for continuous time may be that continuous-time Markov chains are simpler than discrete-time countable-state Markov chains. For instance, in continuous time there are no periodicity issues (in continuous time, ergodic is equivalent to being both irreducible and positive-recurrent, whereas in discrete time for a countable state space, ergodic is equivalent to irreducible, aperiodic and positive-recurrent). However, most people (including me) would say discrete time is simpler than continuous time – the continuous-time theory has a few more technical complications.</p>
<p>Another possible argument may be that continuous-time models are more realistic. For instance, in continuous-time models we can have arbitrary branch lengths, whereas in discrete-time models branch lengths are multiples of a fixed constant. However, I see almost no problems with choosing the constant small enough so we can have a dense-enough range of possible branch lengths as we want.</p>
<p>So both arguments are unconvincing to me.</p>

<p>Interesting question!</p>
<p>Phylogenetic trees are typically parameterized with continuous branch lengths, which gives a point-mutation likelihood in terms of the standard CTMC. This makes it easy to also add a likelihood component from TKF91, etc.</p>
<p>How do you propose incorporating a discrete-time likelihood?</p>

<p>To be honest, I did not understand much beginning with the phrase “which gives a point-mutation likelihood in terms of the standard CTMC”.</p>
<p>What “point-mutation likelihood” are you referring to? And what do you mean by “in terms of the standard CTMC”? I see that in the original TKF91 paper, equation (1) gives a likelihood expression in terms of the equilibrium distribution P_infinity and the transition probabilities P_t(A|C) of the CTMC.</p>
<p>And I don’t see why “this makes it easy to also add a likelihood component from TKF91”.</p>
<p>As for a discrete-time likelihood, maybe it will be just like in continuous time (equation (1) in TKF91 seems to work). (Not sure if that answers what you’re talking about.)</p>
<p>My proposal to “study discrete-time indel models until we understand them well” was motivated by the explicit formulas for the transition probabilities of TKF91. Maybe we can find explicit formulas in the discrete-time case as well (though I suspect someone else might have already done so and I just don’t know about their work).</p>
