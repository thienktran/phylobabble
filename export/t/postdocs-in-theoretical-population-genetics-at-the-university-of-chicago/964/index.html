<p>Post-doctoral Scholar Positions available in:</p>
<p>THEORETICAL POPULATION GENOMICS</p>
<p>Two postdoctoral scholar positions are available in the research group of Matthias Steinrücken in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. In the group, we are developing theoretical, computational and statistical methods for population genomics analysis to study neutral and functional genetic variation in the context of complex demographic scenarios. The exact projects for the scholars will be flexible, though based around ongoing research on coalescent and diffusion-based approaches to infer demographic histories, detect local ancestry, and study selection using population genetic data.</p>
<p>The department of Ecology and Evolution has a very collaborative and unique environment with expertise in theoretical and empirical approaches to questions in ecology and evolutionary genetics. Moreover, the University of Chicago provides ample opportunities for interactions with outstanding researchers in overlapping areas, particularly in the departments of Statistics, Human Genetics, and Genetic Medicine.</p>
<p>Candidates should have a PhD in Statistics, Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, or in a related field with substantial quantitative training. The start date is negotiable, and the salary will be competitive and based on level of experience.</p>
<p>To apply, please send your application to steinrue@uchicago.edu. Your application should include a brief cover letter, a cv, a one-page description of your research interests, and contact information for three references. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis until the positions are filled, but should be received by December 9, 2017 to ensure consideration. Candidates from diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply. Please see <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/steinrueckenlab/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://voices.uchicago.edu/steinrueckenlab/</a> to learn more about the group and send any questions regarding the position to steinrue@uchicago.edu.</p>
