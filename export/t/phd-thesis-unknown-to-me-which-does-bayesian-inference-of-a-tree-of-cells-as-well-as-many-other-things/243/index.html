<p>I was following a reference chain and came across the <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/xp796hy4748">PhD thesis</a> of
<a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~joni/">Jonathan Laserson</a>, who was a Daphne Koller student and now works at Google.</p>
<p>The thesis is interesting. It’s quite ambitious: in one chapter he sets up a Bayesian inference algorithm for a tree of cells (cc <span class="mention">@mathmomike</span>) that explicitly models sequencing error. On the other hand, I can’t see how he got any of this to work efficiently for the sizes of data sets discussed, and his software, called ImmuniTree, is not to be found on the web.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@jeetsukumaran</span> and others may know this fellow from his Genovo de novo assembly software for mixed populations.</p>

<p>The software ImmuniTree features prominently in the <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003754" rel="nofollow noopener">article</a> by Sok et al., but the still I found no link to the software itself. <a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003754.s027" rel="nofollow noopener">Text S1</a> has a fairly detailed description of the Bayesian framework used by ImmuniTree. There are two modeling assumptions that I don’t fully understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mutations are modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain, while the prior over the tree appears to be a continuous-time birth-death process.</li>
<li>Internal nodes of the tree are supposed to be observed, because reads are assigned to all nodes of the tree. It is possible that I simply don’t understand the experimental design used by the authors.</li>
