<p><span class="mention">@mlandis</span> I like that suggestion, but the categories are “flat”, disjoint, and dead-simple. By design, I’m sure.</p>
<p>After a chat with <span class="mention">@trvrb</span> I don’t think that we can have both “type” and “subject” categories. I advocate the latter, as people are more likely to be interested in the majority of posts in a given subject than all papers, for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>alignment</li>
<li>data (incl. NGS)</li>
<li>macroevolution</li>
<li>molecular evolution (sequence models, etc)</li>
<li>software (the actual practice of using software to crunch data and visualize)</li>
<li>traits (incl. morphology, also phylogenomics)</li>
<li>dating &amp; fossils</li>
<li>phylogeography</li>
<li>tree reconciliation (gene-tree vs species-tree, etc)</li>
<li>miscellany (noting that we already have meta)</li>
<li>workshops &amp; meetings</li>
<li>positions: doctoral</li>
<li>positions: postdoc</li>
<li>positions: jobs (split into “faculty” and “other”?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t want to make a “Bayesian” category because that’s pretty cross topic, but what about a “tree posterior” category? Or a “confidence” category?</p>
<p>How about popgen and genetics categories (with the implicit idea that people will be discussing the parts of these fields that touch phylo?)</p>
<p>Other ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>measurably evolving populations</li>
<li>taxonomy (and species delimitation)</li>
<li>math (phylo theory)</li>
</ul>
<p>My sense is that fewer categories are better, but we want everyone to have a place to post.</p>

<p>Popularity will dictate category count to some degree.  A very popular forum might demand more granularity (so if I’m looking for postdoc announcements I don’t have to visually filter grad student positions).  However, if there’s only one post a month, it would be better to have a single ‘positions’ category.</p>
<p>I like the proposed ideas.  My take (trying to combine a bit and shorten names):</p>

<p>I suggest “Events” as a name.</p>
<p>It all depends on who shows, right? I suggest we start with a minimal set and add more categories as folks show. It’s easier to add then remove. With this in mind, I would suggest moving Geography into Traits. Perhaps also get rid of pop gen and data?</p>
<p>The flipside is that we don’t want to make people unenthused because their fave category is missing.</p>

<p>+1 seems like a good starting point; presumably they can split and merge over time if one gets too big.</p>
<p>It might be worth some way of distinguishing between specific requests for help with particular pieces of software (program X won’t run on my data – help) with more general topics (what are limitations of model Y?); this is one reason why I don’t follow r-sig-phylo very closely as it’s hard to spot the more generally interesting topics at a glance.</p>

<p>I have added the categories along with draft definitions. It turns out that you can have nested categories, but I think that leaving it flat at this stage would be a good idea.</p>
<p>I have also added the following bullet point to the “you are new at posting” guidlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this post a request for help with a software package? This is a forum for discussion, not for debugging. We do have a category for discussing specific analyses, which is Troubleshooting, but if your question is about how to run a specific package we suggest that you address the user group for that package.</li>

<p>Hey folks! My sense is still that there are too many categories - people are going to be trying to figure out what this is all about, and keeping it simple to start would help. I am tempted to combine all of the theory into one category for now, and then separate it if and when the number of posts increases to the point that separation makes sense. This also might help with the distinction between “discussion about methods here” and “troubleshooting analyses here”.</p>

<p>Rather than collapse all of the theory into one category, I’d rather have more posts! I think that as soon as there are enough topics to push down the category definitions, it will give people something to say “oh, I see what this is about”, rather than “WTF”.</p>

<p>If the software one is just announcements about new software then I would do that. I imagine though people might want to talk about running software (as opposed to coding which is another thing) as well though so I might leave software and just have announcements about software go in announcements. I would put all announcements in one topic (workshops, open positions, software) and people can just have [SOFTWARE] in the topic. That said, again, I am open to whatever, just a thought.</p>

<p>mmmm…  I thought in something concerning “organismal” issues ( something more broader that would include taxonomy, and its thechnicalities; species concepts; species delimitation…) But I could not think in a better name than “Organisms”</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>

<p>I would like to see a place for discussion of low-level tools for gathering data sets and getting the data ready for analyses.  This work is the bane of my existence when I go outside the Human Immunodeficiency Virus database to gather data sets.</p>
<p>In the genomics/proteomics era, the problem is the flood of data and the sparse annotation of that data.  And when the data is annotated there is a lack of consistency across data sets.   Below species level, terms like “race”, “strain”, “isolate”, “type”, “serotype”, “Subtype” and so on, are frequently critical in the study of viruses, bacteria, plants, animals or other organisms.  For some data sets we may want geographic location or other data.  Many tools will easily pull “ORGANISM” or “Genus-Species” from the database, but have trouble getting the other data, largely because the data is inconsistently annotated to begin with.</p>
<p>It is clearly a pipe dream to wish that NCBI/GenBank or other databases will provide all the information for all organisms and all types of analyses of any given group of organisms.  But there are many tools already developed, and more being built each day, to assist researchers in gathering and organizing their data sets.</p>
<p>For one example, today I just learned of BLAST-EXPLORER from <a href="http://www.phylogeny.fr" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.phylogeny.fr</a> which was published in:
Dereeper et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:8
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/8" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/8</a>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821324/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821324/</a>
Which from the publication looks like it will work great for many vertebrate or plant data sets, but failed badly during my “test drive” because I work with viruses and bacteria.</p>
<p>After gathering and aligning a set of sequences we can still be faced with trivial (from a science view) but annoying issues of getting the data into the right format for analyses.  For example our favorite multiple sequence alignment tool may like to input or output in FASTA format, but we need a different format (NEXUS, SLX, GDE etc) for input to
another analysis tool.</p>
<p>We clearly don’t want to lump this type of discussion in with other topics which are supposed to be about the real science of phylogenetics.  And perhaps we don’t want to have such discussions here in the PHYLOBABBLE site at all.  But I would find it very handy to have a place to share ideas and 'tips and tricks" of the trade.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts, everyone.</p>
<p>Here are my
proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new “Preparation” category that has everything related to gathering data and readying it for</li>
<li>A new “Taxa” category that has organisms, taxonomy, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to make further suggestions. Or you can “like” this post to show your support.</p>

<p>OK, well, I didn’t do what I promised, but I think it’s better.</p>
<p>Sequence alignment and tests for paralogy, etc, are quite nontrivial and so I don’t think that they belong with how to download lots of data. Thus I have changed “Alignment” to “Homology”.</p>
<p>To handle the requests of the Data-folks, I have started a “Practicalities” category, which also includes the visualization of trees, etc.</p>
<p>There is also a new “Taxa” category.</p>
