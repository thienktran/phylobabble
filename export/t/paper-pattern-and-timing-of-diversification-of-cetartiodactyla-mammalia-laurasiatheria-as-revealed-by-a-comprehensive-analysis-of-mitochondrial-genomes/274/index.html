<p>This paper uses complete mitochondrial genome alignments, plus a rather comprehensive table of dates from fossils and other data to calibrate the molecular clock of mammalian mitochondrial DNA evolution at many points in the tree.  With the complete mitochondrial genomes from 210 taxa aligned, this is a rich data set.</p>

The order Cetartiodactyla includes cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) that are
found in all oceans and seas, as well as in some rivers, and artiodactyls (ruminants, pigs,
peccaries, hippos, camels and llamas) that are present on all continents, except Antarctica
and until recent invasions, Australia. There are currently 332 recognized cetartiodactyl
species, which are classified into 132 genera and 22 families. Most phylogenetic studies
have focused on deep relationships, and no comprehensive time-calibrated tree for the
group has been published yet. In this study, 128 new complete mitochondrial genomes of
Cetartiodactyla were sequenced and aligned with those extracted from nucleotide
databases. Our alignment includes 14,902 unambiguously aligned nucleotide characters
for 210 taxa, representing 183 species, 107 genera, and all cetartiodactyl families. Our
mtDNA data produced a statistically robust tree, which is largely consistent with previous
classifications. However, a few taxa were found to be para- or polyphyletic, including the
family Balaenopteridae, as well as several genera and species. Accordingly, we propose
several taxonomic changes in order to render the classification compatible with our
molecular phylogeny. In some cases, the results can be interpreted as possible taxonomic
misidentification or evidence for mtDNA introgression. The existence of three new cryptic
species of Ruminantia should therefore be confirmed by further analyses using nuclear
data. We estimate divergence times using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock models. The
deepest nodes appeared very sensitive to prior assumptions leading to unreliable
estimates, primarily because of the misleading effects of rate heterogeneity, saturation
and divergent outgroups. In addition, we detected that Whippomorpha contains slowevolving
taxa, such as large whales and hippos, as well as fast-evolving taxa, such as river
dolphins. Our results nevertheless indicate that the evolutionary history of cetartiodactyls
was punctuated by four main phases of rapid radiation during the Cenozoic era:
the sudden occurrence of the three extant lineages within Cetartiodactyla (Cetruminantia,
Suina and Tylopoda); the basal diversification of Cetacea during the Early
Oligocene; and two radiations that involve Cetacea and Pecora, one at the Oligocene/
Miocene boundary and the other in the Middle Miocene. In addition, we show that the
high species diversity now observed in the families Bovidae and Cervidae accumulated
mainly during the Late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene.</p>
