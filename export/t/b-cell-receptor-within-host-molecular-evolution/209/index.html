<p><span class="mention">@cmccoy</span>, <span class="mention">@trvrb</span>, <span class="mention">@vminin</span> and I have just put up a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3066">paper</a> on our recent work on B cell molecular evolution. I have also put up a <a href="http://matsen.github.io/talks/bcell-single.html#/">talk</a> about this work.</p>
<p>I wanted to start a thread here so we could get some feedback from the community. Please let us know what you think!</p>

<p>The field of AIDS Vaccines, has become deeply interested in antibody maturation over the past few years.  A lot of really nice work has now been done, thanks to advances in a few different areas such as deep sequencing.  The new techniques, coupled with samples collected from patients over time which were analyzed for breadth of antibody response (how many different strains of HIV-1 can serum from each patient neutralize at each time point) has lead to some really interesting findings, such as those <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature13036.html" rel="nofollow noopener">recently published in Nature</a>.</p>
