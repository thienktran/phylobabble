<p>Are you a creative, motivated, and talented researcher with a background in mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology or operations research? Do you have an interest in making a difference in infectious disease research? Then this is the opportunity for you!
Our group explores a range of problems centred around the study of infectious disease genomes. Our projects straddle computational and systems biology, epidemiology, and public health policy; our current projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an integrative analysis of genomic markers (SNPs, copy numbers, MLST, rearrangements), with the goal of identifying epidemiologically-related strains during a bacterial outbreak</li>
<li>analysis and visualization of genetic, geographic and temporal patterns in an outbreak, with the goal of identifying transmission hotspots and risk factors for tuberculosis</li>
<li>identification and dynamical modelling of bacterial diversity within ticks, with the goal of understanding the ecological processes driving the evolution of Lyme disease pathogens
Our North American collaborators include the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC), the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE), and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH). We also collaborate internationally with groups in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, India, China and South Africa.
The ideal candidate for this position will have:</li>
<li>a PhD in a quantitative discipline (mathematics or computer science preferred) by August 2016</li>
<li>a strong publication record (at least two published papers and one other in preparation)</li>
<li>an interest in designing models and algorithms for solving biological or epidemiological problems</li>
<li>advanced knowledge of at least one of: C++, Java, MATLAB, Python, R</li>
<li>expertise in discrete mathematics, combinatorial optimization, machine learning or statistics</li>
<li>experience in designing and building robust computational pipelines in a Unix-like environment
A complete application should include a statement of interest, a CV, the names of 2 references, and a link to the repository of a programming project you took part in. Please submit applications to Leonid Chindelevitch, leonid@sfu.ca, with “Postdoctoral fellowship” in the subject line. All applications will be considered; preference is given to Canadian citizens or permanent residents. The starting date is September 1, 2016, and the position will remain open until filled.</li>
