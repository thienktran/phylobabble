<p>A postdoctoral position is available to join the recently funded Evolutionary Genomics Research Group (under a highly competitive 5 year grant from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences’ “Momentum” program).</p>
<p>The Evolutionary Genomics research group’s aim is to develop a coherent treatment of evolutionary processes at different time scales, from the diversification of species over hundreds of millions of years, to the decade long development of tumours. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to choose between two topics that are currently the subject of intense scientific interest, each aiming to extract quantitative information on the underlying biological processes from large genomic datasets: 1. reconstructing a dated tree of life from complete genomes using phylogenetic discord as molecular fossils and 2. to understand cancer evolution in hierarchically differentiating tissue using tumour genomes.
The successful candidate will either have a background in Evolutionary Biology, Bioinformatics or a related field, or come from a strong quantitative background such as Applied Mathematics or Statistics, or Statistical or Biological Physics with the ambition to pursue research in Evolutionary Biology.</p>
<p>The position is for up to 5 years with a salary of up to 500,000 HUF per month conditional on experience (adjusting for cost of living this corresponds to approx. EUR 2,500 in Berlin, 2,600 in Vienna and 3,500 in Paris [<a href="http://numbeo.com" rel="nofollow noopener">numbeo.com</a>] ).
The research group is lead by Dr. Gergely Szollosi ( <a href="https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=sPrYT-oAAAAJ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=sPrYT-oAAAAJ</a> ) and actively collaborates with the research groups of Vincent Daubin, Nicolas Lartillot and Bastien Boussau (Evolutionary Genomics and Phylogeny, CNRS, Lyon France) as well as Eric Tannier (Bioinformatics, Computer Science, INRIA Lyon France), Tom Williams (Molecular evolution, phylogenetics , University of Bristol) and Carolin Kosiol (Bioinformatics, Vetmeduni Vienna). The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work with and visit for periods of up to several months the collaborating parties.</p>
<p>The research group is hosted at Eötvös Universities Institute of Physics. The Institute of Physics has been included in the Excellence Group of European Universities, and has achieved top placement in the number of citations, the number of ERC grants, the time available for PhD research and the gender balance of master’s students in the CHE Excellence Ranking. The research group is associated to the Depts. of Biological Physics and Complex Systems composed of several interdisciplinary research groups including those of Prof. Imre Derényi, Prof. Tamás Vicsek, and Prof. István Csabai with experience in the analysis of large scale datasets, including next generation sequencing data.</p>
<p>Please direct all enquiries to Dr. Gergely Szollosi (ssolo@elte.hu).</p>
