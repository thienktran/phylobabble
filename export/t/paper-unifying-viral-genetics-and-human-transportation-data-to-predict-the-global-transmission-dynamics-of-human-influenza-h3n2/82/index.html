<blockquote>
<p>Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial
epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and
other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which
modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales
using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of
pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the
spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely
neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because
no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and
empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this
problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global
spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to
predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide.
Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human
influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of
potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the
global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows,
whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes
that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm
a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a
source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model
output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we
demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most
accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are
integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses
are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial
information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach
introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological
surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving
predictive models of disease control.</p>

<p>Methods highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined
according to four scenarios, as follows: (A) equal rates, (B) rates
proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them (in
terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to
another), (C) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a
standard phylogeographic model (undertaken with and without BSSVS to
reduce the number of rate parameters) and (D) a GLM model that only
considers air travel as a predictor. To compare the spread of
influenza under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic
spread, we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak
times (across 100 simulations) and the observed peak times for all
locations except Mexico (based on World Health Organization data; Text
S1). Correspondence was measured using the Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient, and tested with associated -values obtained using a
permutation test (Text S1), as well as using the mean average error
(MAE; in days). We consider the Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they
are more robust to outliers, which are clearly present in the observed
peaks. Therefore, the scaling of between-population coupling c for the
various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize
Spearman’s rank correlation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A really neat result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global
influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement,
specifically, geographical proximity, demography and economic
measures, antigenic divergence, epidemiological synchronity and
seasonality do not yield noticeable support (Fig. 2). Instead, we find
consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant
driver of the global dissemination of H3N2 influenza viruses. This is
reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable (
on a log scale) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the
model (posterior probability &gt;0.93 and Bayes factor &gt;760).</p>
