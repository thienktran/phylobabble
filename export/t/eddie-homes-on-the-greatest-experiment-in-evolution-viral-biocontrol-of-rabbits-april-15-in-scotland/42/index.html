<blockquote>
<p>The Greatest Experiment in Evolution: Viral Biocontrol of Rabbits</p>
<p>Edward C. Holmes  Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Disease and
Biosecurity, School of Biological Sciences  and Sydney Medical School,
The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.</p>
<p>The wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was successfully
introduced into Australia  in 1859. By the early 1900s rabbits had
crossed the borders of all mainland states  spreading at a rate of
about 70 km a year, the fastest of any colonising mammal. By the
1950s there may have been more than one billion rabbits in Australia.
The introduction of  the rabbit has irrevocably changed the Australian
landscape, significantly affecting both  native flora and fauna.
Rabbits have therefore been vigorously targeted through the
deliberate introduction of two viral control agents: Myxoma virus
(MYXV) was successfully  released in Australia in the 1950s, while
Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV)  escaped from quarantine
field trials in 1995.    Through the application of genome-scale
phylogenetic methods I will describe the patterns,  processes and
outcomes of these unique and grand-scale experiments in evolution. In
particular, I will show how viral virulence has evolved in both cases
(the example of MYXV in  European rabbit is the canonical study of the
evolution of virulence), and how phylogenetic  methods provide a
valuable insight into the genomic determinants of virulence evolution.
In  addition, phylogenetic analysis of the spread of both MYXV and
RHDV in the Australian  environment provides key information on the
rates, patterns and dynamics of pathogen  evolution in a naïve
environment, and represents a powerful analogy to cases of disease
emergence following cross-species virus transmission to a novel host.
I will close by discussing the possible evolutionary consequences of
the next grand viral  biocontrol experiment planned for Australia: the
release of Koi herpesvirus (KHV) to control  the common carp that was
also introduced to Australia in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>Perhaps we could petition them to broadcast it? The rest of the program looks pretty fantastic too.</p>

<p>It was a great meeting. Of particular interest for those of you who could not make it -</p>
<p>Slides from Eddie Holmes, and videos of the talks by Nick Goldman and Robert Gifford, are now available here:</p>
