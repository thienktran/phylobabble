<p>MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology 12-16 June 2017
Porquerolles Island, South of France.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-registration deadline extended to March 6th 2017</strong></p>
<p>Notification to applicants: March 17th</p>
<p>Final list of attendees: April 17th</p>
<p>Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and concepts form an essential basis for modern evolutionary studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 9th edition) is to bring together scientists with diverse backgrounds to present recent advances and discuss open problems in the field of mathematical and computational evolutionary biology. The theme of this year’s edition will be <strong>“Methods for integrative evolutionary biology: various sources of data, various scales of evolution”</strong>, which includes the analysis of heterogeneous data (molecular, phenotypic, ecological…), different time scales (from recent times to the origin of life), different spatial scales (from local to worldwide range), the combination of phylogenetics and population genetics, multidisciplinary approaches, etc… General concepts, models, methods and algorithms will also be presented and discussed, just as during the previous conference editions.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Conference fees including accommodation for four nights, meals, coffee breaks, etc., will be around 450 euros, all inclusive. PhD students and postdocs would benefit of financial support.</p>
