<p>Would someone be able to point me to a generalisation of the Fitch algorithm to calculate parsimonious length for a topology, but which works for non-binary trees?</p>
<p>Actually our goal is to calculate consistency index correctly, in the face of (possibly) ambiguous DNA base symbols (R, Y, S, V, M, etc).</p>
<p>Getting consistency index involves knowing the minimum conceivable length of a tree, calculated for each character individually.</p>
<p>This part of the problem seems equivalent to calculating tree length, for each character separately, for a ‘bush’ topology in which all terminals are connected directly to the root.</p>
<p>I’m just not quite sure how to do that. But I’m sure it is known, in general.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>An algorithm for computing the parsimony score for a discrete character on ANY tree (binary or not) was described in this early paper:
Hartigan, J. A. (1973). Minimum mutation fits to a given tree. Biometrics, 29,
53–65.
It’s a dynamic-programming style approach and runs quickly (not quite as fast as the Fitch algorithm).</p>
<p>But if your tree is actually a star tree, with all leaves attached to the root, it’s quite a bit simpler —  if there are n leaves, then the most parsimonious assignment(s) are precisely the one(s) that  assign the root  any state x that occurs most often (say k times) at the leaves; in which case the parsimony score for this assignment will be n-k (I.e. one change is needed on each edge leading to one of the other leaves).
hope that helps.
best,
Mike</p>
